A starting project built to understand and get my hands dirty with React. 
I referred a youtube course for this while trying and exploring differnt things, tackling errors and version change issues, using stack-overflow too overcome them.
The website is a simple Meetup Website which also connects to a backend FireBase to store data and retrieve it. THe favorites is still a temporary saving feature which stores your favorites in the browser cache, and not in the backend. That is something I would eventually like to build up on.
